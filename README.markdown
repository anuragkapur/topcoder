##Repo Structure and Project Settings
* Programming Language: Java 7 | IDE: Intellij13 | Plugin: [intellijcoder](https://github.com/fadeyev/intellijcoder)
* [SRM challenges](srms)
* [TopCoder Open 2014](tco14)

Pre Jan 2015, each problem was in its own subdirectory, each of which is an Intellij Project Module. Example: [srms/srm615/AmebaDiv1](srms/srm615/AmebaDiv1)

More recently there is one IntelliJ modeule per SRM. Example: [srms/srm650-div2](srms/srm650-div2), with problem statements in the [resources](srms/srm650-div2/resources) folder and source and test cases in [src](srms/srm650-div2/src) and [test](srms/srm650-div2/test) respectively.
